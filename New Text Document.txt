Go over my project folders and files, open them, if it is git repository link read  it and download its files in the folder. 
after you will generate one single react home page that has all of my six projects posted/listed (i.e: folders ) on it. every project on my react home page should allow the user to open it and display a react page instead of it to display .ipynb file.
i understand some of my projects were only built as .ipynb and has no react version ready to deploy however i want you build it now. (use react not .ipynb). if it has no react make sure you train my ai as it is required the build a react page for it that will be posted on single showcase home page.
Design this react home page to allow it be deployed on streamlit as a single project even though it combines multiple projects. the purpose of this is that i wanna use free version of streamlit and it's free version only allows a single project to be deployed on it.
